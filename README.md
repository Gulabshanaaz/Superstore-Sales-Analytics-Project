# Sales Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard 📊

This project showcases an end-to-end business intelligence solution built using SQL and Power BI. It analyzes sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends using a simulated Superstore retail dataset. The dashboard is designed for cross-functional stakeholders to monitor KPIs and drive data-informed decisions.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To develop an interactive dashboard that provides insights into:
- Regional and monthly sales performance
- Customer segments and purchasing behavior
- Product category and sub-category trends
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit margin, and order volume

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard development
- **SQL** – For data transformation, joining, filtering, and aggregation
- **Python (Optional)** – For data preprocessing (Jupyter Notebook included)
- **Dataset** – Superstore retail dataset (available in `.csv` and `.sql` formats)

---

### 📌 Problem Statement

This project addresses the need to analyze and extract actionable insights from the sales data of a fictional superstore. Key challenges include cleaning messy raw data, transforming it into an analyzable format, identifying performance trends, and visualizing KPIs in a way that supports business decision-making.

### ✅ Solution

The solution integrates Python, SQL, and Power BI to build a complete data analysis pipeline. The workflow includes:

- **Data Cleaning:** Used Python to clean and prepare the raw Excel dataset.
- **Data Modeling:** Converted cleaned data into CSV and imported it into a SQL database for structured querying.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Performed analysis using SQL to derive insights into sales trends, customer segments, and product performance.
- **Visualization:** Designed interactive Power BI dashboards to present insights in a user-friendly and decision-oriented manner.

This project demonstrates the power of combining data engineering, analytics, and visualization tools to deliver business-ready insights.
