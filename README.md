# Sales Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard 📊

This project showcases an end-to-end business intelligence solution built using SQL and Power BI. It analyzes sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends using a simulated Superstore retail dataset. The dashboard helps teams across departments track key metrics and make better business decisions based on data.
